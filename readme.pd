# Energy-Aware CPU Scheduling Algorithm (EARR)

### Description
This project implements an Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm based on Round Robin. It uses Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to reduce CPU power consumption while maintaining fairness and performance.

### Modules
1. **scheduler.py** — Implements Round Robin scheduling.
2. **energy_module.py** — Handles DVFS logic and power calculation.
3. **visualization.py** — Generates charts comparing power, energy, and scheduling.
4. **main.py** — Entry point for execution.

### Power Model
\[
P = 0.5 \times f^3 + 0.1
\]

### Run
```bash
python main.py
